</h1>

MINT-1T is an open-source **M**ultimodal **INT**erleaved dataset with one trillion text tokens and three billion images, a 10x scale-up from existing open-source datasets. Additionally, we include previously untapped sources such as PDFs and ArXiv papers. **We are putting the final touches on MINT-1T and will open-source the dataset soon!**

## Updates
- We released our [technical report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11271).
